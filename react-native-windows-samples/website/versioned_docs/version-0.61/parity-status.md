[React Native Components and APIs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis) that are a part of the [React Native Lean Core](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313) effort are now all supported in React Native for Windows.

For a more closely monitored look at our work in progress, check out the [API Completion](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/labels/API%20Completion) label on issues in our repo.

> Please feel free to leave comments or give us a üëç on issues to help us prioritize better!

A few methods or props may be missing on some types and we are actively working to add support for those in our [upcoming milestones](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/milestones).

If you encounter an unsupported API that should be tracked, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/issues/new/choose) to let us know.

## Supported Community Modules
We are in the process of ejecting the components and modules that are not part of React Native Lean Core into their respective [community repos](https://github.com/react-native-community).

The following were completed recently:

| Name | Status | Implemented |
|:-|:-|-:|
| <ins>[react-native-webview](https://www.github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview)</ins> | **Completed** |Mar 17, 2020 |

In addition, we are working on adding Windows support to popular and highly requested community modules. You can keep track on the progress of both these efforts through the [Community Modules support project board](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/projects/23).

If there is an unsupported community module that you don‚Äôt see in our roadmap, please [submit a support request](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/issues/new/choose) and let us know.
