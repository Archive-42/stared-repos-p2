- [Interesting approach to raise price based off number of items sold. Start at $10, after 30 sales, raise to $15 etc.](https://gumroad.com/l/doing-content-right)
- [I feel like something almost everybody gets wrong about subscription pricing in their apps is not having a ‘no brainer’ tier as an onramp.

- [Give away general info, charge for contextual advice. Make the value for the customer immediately obvious. Pricing should be straightforward.](https://twitter.com/VicVijayakumar/status/1424173615847772161)
