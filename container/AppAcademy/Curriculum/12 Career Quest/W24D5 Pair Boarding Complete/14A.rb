# Word Chains
# Given a source word, target word and an English dictionary, transform the source word to target by changing/adding/removing 1 character at a time, while all intermediate words being valid English words. Return the transformation chain which has the smallest number of intermediate words.

# Solutions

# I use Ruby's `Set` class for collections I need to call `#include?`
# on; `#include?` is much faster on a `Set` than an `Array`. Don't
# worry, Arrays would work fine, too, just more slowly.
