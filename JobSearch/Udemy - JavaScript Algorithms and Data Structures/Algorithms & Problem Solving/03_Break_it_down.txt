Break it down
  - write down the steps of what the code will do
  - explicitly write out the steps you need to take (just the basic components)
  - this forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g. language syntax) as well.

Example: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each letter in a string


Skeleton of your function:
function charCount(str){
  // do something
  // return an object with keys that are lowercase alphanumeric characters in a string; values should be counts for characters
}

Let's be more detailed
function charCount(str){
  // make object to return at end
  // loop over string for each character
    // if the char is a number/letter AND is a key in object, add one to count
    // if the char is a number/letter AND is not in object, add it to object and set value to 1
    // if character is something else (space, period, etc.) don't do anything
  // return object at end
}

This demonstrates that you have formulated an approach, so that if you ran out of time, the interviewer knows where you were headed
