# WEEK 5 STUDY SUGGESTIONS

Here is a suggested outline for studying this weekend:

1. Fill In Learning Objective Document
	 - first: fill out the empty LO document on your own (`LOs-empty.md`)
	 - then: compare your document with the filled out version (`LOs-explained.md`)


2. Review Weekly Notes
   - additional notes on each days' topics can be found in the `notes` directory


3. Review the warmup exercises in the `warmups` directory
   - inside you will find both of the warmup exercises we worked on this week
	 - instructions for each can be found in their respective `README.md` files




# ASSESSMENT FORMAT

  - Multiple Choice x10
  - Online Coding Environment x2
  - VSCode Questions
    - Four .js files that you'll have to code in
    - Pass the mocha specs for each file (17 specs total)
    - We will use CommonJS for requiring/exporting files
      - We will use `module.exports = ClassName`, `module.exports = { ClassName }`, or `exports.ClassName = ClassName` for exporting. Know the differences and how to use each.
      - We will use `const ClassName = require('./file/path')` or `const { ClassName } = require('./file/path')` for importing. Know the differences and how to use each.
    - ES Modules import/export syntax (like what is used in Connect Four) is important for you to know moving forward in the curriculum; it is what allows us to import files in a browser environment. However, you will not be writing it on the assessment as we will only be running specs in a Node environment, where CommonJS is still the default.
      - Fun fact: ES6 Modules are an experimental feature in Node. Maybe one day they'll take over as the default! :fingers-crossed:
