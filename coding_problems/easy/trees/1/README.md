# Depth First Search

You are given a Node class that has a name and an array of optional chidlre nodes. When put together, nodes form an acyclic tree-like structure.

Implement the `depthFirstSearch` method on the `Node` class, which takes in an empty array, traverses the tree using the Depth-first Searh approach (left to right), stores all of the node's names in the input array and returns it.
