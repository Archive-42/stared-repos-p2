Upside and Downside of negotiating
  Common Answers:
  - Benefits
    - More money
    - Convey confidence
    - Get a feel for management style
    - Feel appreciated -> better work
    - Company wants you to be happy
    - Leverage for future raises & Negotiations
  - Drawbacks (these rarely happen)
    - Offer withdrawn -> happens less than 1% of the time
    - Appear selfish
    - Raise the performance bar (afraid you'll have to do more work)

REMEMBER...
  ELI's FAVORITE LINE: "You cant wink at someone in the dark!"
    - If you do not ask, you do not Get
    - NOBODY is going to manage your career better than you
    - Unless you ask for the raise/promotion, no one is going to do it for you
  
Cost of conducting a round of interviews
  - Advertise job, attend events and review resumes
    - 2 - 3 days of recruiter time
    - 1/2 day of hiring manager time
  - Setup and conduct 10 - 20 phone screens
    - 2 - 3 days of recruiter time
  - Send, collect, and grade 5 - 10 take-home problems
    - 1/2 day of recruiter time
    - 1/2 day of engineer time
  - Arrange and conduct 3 in-person interviews
    - 1 day recruiter time
    - 2 days engineer time
  - Create offer and comunicate with final candidate
    - 1/2 day recruiter/hiring manager time
  TOTAL: ~7 days recruiter time, !2.5 days manager/engineer time

  Assuming employee salaries of $100k: Cost of 1 round of interviews ~$10,000

From an employee/emploer standpoint...
  - They are exhausted
  - They feel rejected
  - Their entire product is delayed
  - Takes time to get someone
  - It takes time for a recruiter to get you to negotiations

Typical cost of employing one engineer @$100k
  - An extra $85k could be a hidden cost to keep you there (benefits, taxes, etc.)

Employee happiness is extremely important
  - Just to train you can cost $80k

Takeaways
  - Companies don't benefit from being stubborn
  - The vast majority of negotiations do result in a better deal
    - Maybe not a higher salary, but other bonuses
  - Close to half of negotiation gain are ~$10k or more

Getting the offer... NOW WHAT?
- When you get an offer:
  - TELL YOUR COACH!!
  - Tell every other company that you have an offer
  - Ask for more time
  - If you get more time, interview with other places
  - If you don't get the time, ask for more money
  - Always get any additional info about the position before negotiating salary
  - If you get more than one offer, you can have up to two back-and-forth negotiation rounds
    - any more and it will seem like you're greedy
  - "I'll forego my other opportunities and sign today if _____."

Navigating the negotiation: (KNOW FOR THE REST OF YOUR CAREER)
  Three Cardinal Rules
    - RULE #1: Never give a salary at the start
      - Try not to give away the first number
        - "My priorrity is to find a company that offers [mentorship | a great product | an excellent team | whatever matters to you]"
        - "I am confident we'll be able to make an agreement when the time comes."
        - "I don't have enough information about the role to evaluate it yet, but on [Glassdoor | Indeed | elsewhere] I have noted that salaries are typically around [find a high number]."
      REPEAT AFTER ME:
        "For me it is really about the culture, fit and position.   (it is too early to talk about it)
        Right now may be a little early for this discussion.        (you need to know what the median salary in your area and for the company is)
        (the kiss up)
        However, when WE do get there, I will be looking at Glassdoor and the local market and I am sure we find something that will be win-win for everyone."
      - DO NOT use the actual word 'NEGOTIATION'
    - Rule #2: Try to get things in writing
      - Verbal offer...
      - Response:
        "Wow. That offer sounds amazing. I am going to look forward to reviewing the offer in email and taking some time to consider next stpes as this is a big life decision. I definitely want to discuss this with (my family, partner, colleague...)

        I really like the people and the position seems like a great fit and I am excited about the opportunity."
      - Don't tell them whether you like the offer or not
      - When people start negotiating on the phone, people get nervous
      - It is essential to get everything in writing and do all negotiating in writing
    - Rule #3: DON'T NEGOTIATE OVER THE PHONE "Thank your for this information.  I'll think it over and get back to you."
      - If you get stuck on the phone...
        1) Remember that your first goal is to ASK FOR MROE TIME!
        2) KNOW YOUR IDEAL SALARY, and your Deal-Breaker salary in advance.  Also prepare a brief but clear description of why you are a great hire.
        3) If you get caught up in a salary negotiation, when they name a number, REPEAT THE NUMBER AND THEN BE SILENT FOR A COUNT OF 10
          ( they will feel uncomfortable, and ask you questios or say that they are flexible.)
        4) Make sure the offer is 'firm', "So if I accept X dollars, then this contract is finalied?"
          - MOVE TO EMAIL: "I'll look forward to reviewing this." (Get it in writing)
        5) "I don't want to make any demands, but can I tell you my ideal number?"  They'll say yes, then say the number
          (don't talk for a count of 10)
        - If the offer is super low, they don't move to #5.  REMIND THEM HOW ECITED ARE ABOUT THE OFFER, AND ASK FOR TIME TO DECIDE.
          - then leverage this offer for other purposes.
      - "Yes, but we still would like a number..."
        - Online applications
        - Research BEFORE phone and onsite interviews (GlassDoor, Payza, LinkedIn Salaries)
          - What does Glassdoor or Indeed say about salaries
          - Research the demographics and other companies in and out of state (depending on where you are applying)
        - Say something like 
          - "Basically what I am seeing on Glassdoor and the Bay area is around the $120k range and when we do get to that point, I know your cmopany will provide a fair offer that will be a WIN-WIN for everyone"
        - IF THEY GO THERE...
          - "Recent stats over the last 12months have shown that a/A graduates on average, in the Bay area are making over $110k"

  - early Stages vs. Onsite... KISS UP!!!!
    - Early: "Right now I think it is early in the process to discuss this.  However, for me it is about the culture and fit. When we get to that point, I will be looking towards GlassDoor and the marketplace and in the end, I know we will be able to come up with a number that will be a win-win for both of us."
    - Onsite: "For me it is about the culture and fit.  I am confident you will provide a fair and competitive offer based on what is happening here in the local market"
    - Need a Number: "Based on what I am seeing on Glassdoor and the marketplace, I am looking at the $XXX RANGE.  However, I am very excited about your cmopany and what you are doing here and am confident we can find something that will work for us all."
      - It's important not to say "85 - 95 range" because they'll always choose the lower.  Just say "95 RANGE" because range lets them know you're open to negotiate
  - Who are you negotiatin with?
    - Inside vs Outside recruiters
      - If you are working with an outside recruiter, you do not have to pay for anything (they're not getting money out of your pocket for bringing you in)
      - Inside recruiters use their inside recruiters to outsource and find people like you.
