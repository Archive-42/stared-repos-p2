- [The moment you initiate a business relationship with anyone outside of your company, you should be registering it, as the contracts should be between the corporate entity and the vendor rather than you (personally) with the vendor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/oz8m6m/registering_a_company/)
