# frontend-guide
HTML, CSS, JS sintaxis overview, demos and exercises, insight into CSS/JS frameworks and multiple tools for web developers in general, all done for educational purpose.

### MY META: 
I am doing this public repository, following my will to help anyone who desires to become a self-taught web devoleper,
or just give some new knowledge to those who are looking for, to show the "path" to learning frontend development I've taken, from beginner to advance.
I do not intend to make a "How to do approach - tutorials", but instead, give you functional and practical demostrations for each single tool I learned through the courses and experiments I've done,
so that given these, and with the full projects as examples, you can come up with ideas of how to assembly this functionalities and combine those tools
that are given to you to develop your own ideas and projects. Also, this repository it's not intended to have a sequential or any kind of order, but instead, I give you the power to decide what you what you want to learn,
and when, only guided by your own curiosity or actual knowledge.
