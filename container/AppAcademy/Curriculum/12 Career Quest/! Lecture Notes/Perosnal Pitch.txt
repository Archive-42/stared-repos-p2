What is the most important part of an interview?
  - CONNECTION
    - They have to visualize you in the role
      - Can they work with you every day for 10 hours
      - Do they know you can code
    - The image gives them a positive emotional reaction
    - The same is true for networking, phone call, and on-site
  The Question with a Thousand Faces
    - "Tell me about yourself"
      - Walk me through your background
      - What brings you here?
      - Why did you decide to switch careers?
    - Answer in 1-2 Minutes!
  The Problem: It's difficult to get to know you.
    - You vs #you
    - You: Complex, Hidden depths, no idea what You are
    - #You: Simple, Like I know #you already, #you're hired
  Nervous Energy
    - What are some of the stories you tell yourself before/during the interview?
    - Are you telling yourself a story or the truth?
    - Remember, they already like you!
      - Phone Screen
      - Onsite (Icing on the cake)
    "Giving away your power" when you have nervous Energy
      - Remember, Oxygen mask for you first
      - Power vs powerless -- They have no power over you

      - How did you start in this industry?
      - What do you know?  (Skill & Projects)
      - You and Company - What is your value? "Hit the ground running"
        - By the time they get to you, they need more people or have lost someone
    START:
      - I am a software engineer
        - Ever since high school...
        - I really love solving problems...
      - What skills and projects do you know
        - I built an AirBNB clone with Ruby on Rails with a Postgres back end...
        - Need to show case I know technical things.
      - Make your ending easy (Hit the ground running)
        - Hey, I know you guys are looking for a front end enginner and based on my skills and my experience, I know I can hit the ground running with your team
      - Tell a story
        - Keep it simple and concise
        - If you think you're rambling, you're rambling
        - Need to practice, revise, practice, revise.
      Newbie vs. Knowledgeable
        - BAD: Well I went to App Academy where I learned Ruby, Rails and Javascript which I am getting much better at.
        - GOOD: This past year I have sharpened my skills in Ruby, Rails, and Javascript and recently created an awesome... {XYZ Project}... etc.
        - Nothing wrong with being new, but come across as Knowledgeable

  - Feedback given via InterviewDB, as well as deadlines given
  
Personal Pitch Triangle - We remember things in 3s
    - What made you become a software developer
      - How did you start in this industry?
      - What do you know?  (Skill & Projects)
      - You and Company - What is your value? "Hit the ground running"
        - By the time they get to you, they need more people or have lost someone


"So, tell me about yourself.  What have you done in your career and what brought you here?"

1. How did you get started in the industry? or Why did you want to become a developer?

2. What languages do you know? Discuss one or two (max) projects you have worked on.

3. Something about you and the company and what and how you specifically bring value. ie "I know you work on XYZ stacks and with my experience on ABC project I know I would easily be able to integrate with your team and hit the ground running." or "The reason I really would like to work for XYZ company as I share your companies core values, especially......"


Brainstorming
Before crafting your pitch, ask yourself these questions:

- When did you write your first line of code? Writing BASIC functions on your TI graphing calculator in middle school counts. Thatâ€™s how a lot of successful programmers got started.
- Why did you choose to major in X?
- How did you decide on web development?
- How do your major and web development relate in your mind (Get creative)
- What online resources did you use before applying to App Academy?


Telling Your Story
Your life story should be just that -- a story. It should have a beginning, middle, and end. Each piece should be concrete and specific. Start with one of the first times you encountered code (or some type of problem solving that is tech-related). Then describe your transition into web development. At the end, bring your listener to the present: you are a trained web developer ready to start working for their company.

A sample outline for your inspiration: (beginning)

Beginning: "In college I chose to major in ... and took a lot of classes in ... because I like working on problems that involve ... At company I accomplished ... and ... While I was at it I learned ..."
Middle: "I've always had an affinity for computers so I taught myself HTML and JavaScript for fun. When I picked up Ruby two years ago, I immediately got hooked. I was playing around on Ruby Monk every day after work. I wanted to take it to the next level so I took some classes."
Bring up App Academy if they ask for details. Also mention online courses like Coursera, Ruby Monk, etc.
End: "I've now built two games in JavaScript and one full-stack web app using Bootstrap and Rails. I want to join company because ..."
Notice that each part of the story includes specific details such as time/place, projects, and accomplishments. A few specifics are critical for your listener to fully understand your story.

Pitch Tip 1:
When creating your personal pitch keep in mind that about 40% should be about you and 60% should be about your life/experience as a developer (How you got started, what you have done/are working on, why you love the industry, etc.) BE SPECIFIC...what have you done tech related (ie. HTML, CSS, C, Java).

Pitch Tip 2:
Your pitch IS important. The best way to practice is to record yourself giving your pitch and playing it back. Record yourself on your phone so you can hear what you sound like. Are you loud and clear? Do you have filler words? Talking too fast? Listen as a Recruiter would hear you for the first time. To practice for onsite interview take a video of yourself giving your pitch. Do you have good eye contact? Are you Fidgety?

Pitch Tip 3: (rambling)
If you think you're rambling, just stop.  Finish your sentence.  Take a moment and bring it back.

As adults we learn quicker when we can see and hear ourselves. You may not notice your nervous tendencies in the moment so it is important to address them before your interviews!
