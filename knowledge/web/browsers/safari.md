# [Safari](https://www.apple.com/lae/safari/)

My favorite browser. It is incredibly fast & cares about my privacy unlike Chrome.

Here are websites I have in my `Favorites` which are usually sites I want super fast access to from iOS Safari:

As it is my most used app, I like to script and automate as much of my use of it as possible.

I use [this amazing workflow](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-safari-assistant) to quickly jump between my currently active Safari tabs as well as search through my history and bookmarks.

I also open any of my most used websites using [KM macros](../../macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros.md). The macro opens the website I specify or if the website is open anywhere in Safari and will jump between the tabs of the website. I use this macro for my most used websites and I can open any website I wish with a single keypress. Both open and switch between various websites.

I mention Safari Extensions I use [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os#safari-extensions).

My favorite of which is [Vimari](https://github.com/televator-apps/vimari) which adds a custom layer of keybinds you can customize to personalize your browsing experience.

## Notes

- It's useful to turn on `Show full website address` option in settings.

- There's 500 open tabs limit on Safari. To clear tabs on iOS, long press the bookmark icon, then save all tabs into a folder. Can then open the tabs in the folder from macOS & clear or go through.
