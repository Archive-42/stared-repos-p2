# Ego

Ego is who I am. Without ego, there is no I.

[PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page) describes [ego death as memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Memory_suppression&_=#Ego_death). Without your memory, there is no you.

I had an experience of true ego death only once on [Salvia](../drugs/psychedelics/salvia.md). In those brief moments, I did not know that I was a human person who just smoked some drug. My experience was completely foreign to me (like an observer that has no control of what I get to experience or feel). There is a brief moment where I thought, wow I just died. Only to have a wild experience that is hard/impossible to put into words for some unknown time. Eventually you do come back as 'you'. With all the memories you had before you smoked and a quickly diminishing recollection of the wild experience you just had. DMT is supposedly like that too but I never had a breakthrough experience on it yet.

One thing I always keep at top of my mind as far as ego goes is that I am not a 'main character' in this [story of life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgzQuE1pR1w). [Everyone else around me lives a life as complicated or more complicated as me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkoML0_FiV4). Everyone has the capacity to get hurt and feel pain. And everyone can be happy. I should never be better of at the cost of someone else. I should strive to lift everyone around me up.

I like to believe in the idea of [Pantheism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pantheism/). I and every other conscious human/animal in this universe is part of one conscious being that is the universe itself.

## Notes

- [According to Buddhism, birth and death are both illusions of the self or the ego](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/6i7d2r/sowe_dont_really_die_do_we/)
- [The value of ego loss is primarily in self analysis. The social constructs that normally limit your thinking, and beliefs, are lifted. It allows for a free flow of thought that can only be attributed to your being. At least that's my thought behind it. I primarily use psychedelics as a learning tool, not expecting to learn anything larger about the world or universe, just hoping to learn more about myself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/8d7d1j/so_whats_the_actual_point_of_ego_death/)
- [Ego death is a sudden realization of your eternal nature.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/8d7d1j/so_whats_the_actual_point_of_ego_death/)
- [One way to compare them would be that nn dmt is an immersive visual experience but there is still a perceiver of events as there is a duality between subject and object, eg seeing entities that are perceived to be separate from the self, 5 meo dmt induces complete ego death where there is no longer even a perciever of events, all boundaries disappear and your awareness becomes infinite. This is why people believe that you become God on a 5 meo breakthrough](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/9ssa0g/dmt_vs_5meo_dmt/)
- [Focus on the past, that’s ego. Focus on the future, that’s pride. Focus on the present, that’s humility.](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1416642821663035396?s=28)
- [The real ego death is in seeing your humanity, seeing how flawed you are, taking accountability, and working to be a light, not to guide others to the light.](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/osbis4/i_think_ive_got_mania_because_of_1cplsd/)
