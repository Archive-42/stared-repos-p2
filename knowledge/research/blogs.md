# Blogs

I use [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/mac/) to stay on top of my favorite blogs I follow which I sync with [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) between phone and mac.

I separate blogs I follow by quality into `1.` & `2.` folders accordingly.

I share my [XML subscription feed of blogs I follow](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/63b5d2418122fcd6949d854dc5080689). I also follow some people on [Medium](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/following).
