This document describes the release strategy for the [`vnext`](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/blob/master/README.md) effort for React Native for Windows.

The `vnext` versioning will generally follow the same strategy as outlined in current [Releases](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/blob/0.60-stable/current/docs/Releases.md).

Specifically,

- We release in lock-step with [facebook/react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). I.e., for every release of `react-native`, we create a release of `react-native-windows` with a matching major version.
- We will use a pre-release flag: `-vnext` - to differentiate this C++ implementation followed by the current vnext version number.

For example:

```
...
react-native@0.57.* -> react-native-windows@0.57.0-vnext.*
react-native@0.58.* -> react-native-windows@0.58.0-vnext.*
...
```
