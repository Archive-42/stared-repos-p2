## PERFORMING UNDER PRESSURE!

**"Everybody has a plan till you get punched in the face."  ~Mike Tyson.**  

Same is true on these tests.

What is the worst part of an assessment?  Its not missing a spec or being confused, its the moment when it stops going according to plan.  That's when we start to question whether its just not our day, or even whether programming is maybe just not for us?

## Neurology basics

Brain is 3% of your body weight but uses 20% of your body's energy.  Evolution has trained brains to be as efficient as possible, it does this via pattern matching and hypothesizing about what is going to happen.  It does this so it doens't have to use as much energy for every decision .

Brains will pattern match either for or against us.

## Importance of a mental model.

Mental model is your expectation going into an event.  It exists whether you actively think about it or not.

If your mental model for a test is the expectation of it being easy and acing it, as soon as something goes wrong, your brain tries to pattern match, it clearly doesn't match that pattern, so it jumps to a different model, one of failure, and you start to freak out.  

Your sympathetic nervous system takes over.  Fight or flight. VERY BAD for test taking.
Diverts blood from brain!

If your mental model is based on the expectation of it being challenging, and hitting bugs, but still being able to work through it and pass, then your brain sees the struggle, but is able to successfully pattern match to it, and you're able to stay calm.

## Agency vs Determinism

Seeing things as being deterministic means thinking the outcome is outside of your control.

Agency is the belief that your actions have an effect on the outcome.  It basically means the belief that you are in control of your own outcome.

"I hope I do well on this exam" Is a deterministic way of looking at it.  "I plan to work hard" is believing in your own agency.

Determinism is extra bad because of your brains pattern matching.  If it starts to look ominous, your brain pattern matches to a negative one, and you start to feel like its just not your day, because things are out of your control.

Maintain agency!!

## Nervous vs excited

The physical reaction to being nervous is the same as the physical reaction to being excited. They are both a sympathetic nervous system response.  Sweaty palms, elevated heart rate, butterflies in the stomach etc.

How we CHOOSE to interpret that feeling it up to us.  We can choose to say that we feel nervous, or choose to interpret that feeling as being excited.

Elite Athletes all experience the same physical sensation, they just choose to parse it as excitement. 

Going into an assessment saying "I'm excited" makes it easier to deal with it, and easier to feel pumped up about it, rather than beaten down.

## Breathing exercises.

The body needs 2 kinds of fuel, food, and oxygen.  Both are about equally important.  If you can improve the quality of your breathing, that has a roughly similar effect as improving the quality of ALL of the food that you eat.  In short, breathing matters a lot.

When people are stressed, they over breath.  This means too much inhalation, not enough exhalation.  Hyperventalation.  Imagine people having a panic attack.  

Breathing regulates blood gas levels of 02 (oxygen) vs C02 (Carbon Dioxide) . When you inhale too much, don't exhale enough, blood gas levels get out of whack, and you have too much 02 in your blood, which increases your stress levels, and does all sorts of other bad things.

The solution to this is easy to practice though!  3-9s and 4-12.  Its a drill where you're going to make your exhale take 3 times as long as your inhale.  Breath in through the nose, and out through the mouth.  Make your inhale take a full 3 seconds, but then be exhaling full 9 full seconds.  Purse the lips to regulate airflow.  Once you can do this, do it with 4 and 12, 5-15, etc.  

Doing this forces full exhalation, regulates blood gas levels, and manages stress response.

DO THIS DURING THE TEST.  When you're starting to freak out, even 2 reps of 3-9 3-9, can have a pretty big effect on your mental state.  It takes less than 30 seconds, and can have a tremendously calming effect.  

## Carlos' Sick message he writes to himself at the start of assessments.
"You will pass. If you hit a bug don't freak out. Breath and figure it out. You got this! You will get through App Academy. You will be a great developer!!!"
