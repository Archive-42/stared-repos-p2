# User Experience

## Notes

- Like how [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) does the hamburger menu on mobile.
- [Underappreciated competitive advantage: letting people do x without creating an account.](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1261976515408990208)
- Love how both Apple & [Linear](https://linear.app/release-2020-12) present features in neat boxes on a grid.
- [My firmest design opinion is that every piece of software should have a cute animal mascot that helps you out as you go through onboarding and stuff. No exceptions.](https://twitter.com/ctbeiser/status/1367626163405746176)
- [There are lots of things that engineers can learn from the design community but these two are particularly important: 1. Being able to visually compare variations of your work side by side is really useful. 2. Creating duplicates of your current work should be fast and easy.](https://twitter.com/tylerangert/status/1390680065399209989)
- [Rare destructive action where you need to be sure of user intention.](https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1407751390961750021)
- [Don't use 16px icons on web, they're hard to tap. If you want to use 16px, wrap it in a 24px container, this will increase the tappable area, whilst maintaining the size of the icon.](https://twitter.com/darylginn/status/1409534276341841922)
- [Can right click on Vercel home icon to see brand assets](https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1422191357083455489)
- [New user onboarding and activation is one of the most critical things for teams to test. Unfortunately it’s also one of the hardest, since people don’t go though the NUX flow more than once as a matter of course. So most teams stay blissfully unaware of what new users experience.](https://twitter.com/gokulr/status/1432295804052647937)
- [One of the coolest onboarding tricks I've seen recently - do different tasks for a product onboarding to add days to your free trial.](https://twitter.com/kushaanshah/status/1433210611895189509)
