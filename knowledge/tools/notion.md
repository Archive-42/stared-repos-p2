# [Notion](https://www.notion.so)

Use it for projects as a wiki of docs, notes, todos. I [share most boards in public](../sharing/my-notion.md).

## Notes

- To open Notion page directly in macOS app. Get the share link. Will look like `https://www.notion.so/nikitavoloboev/Ideas-0b5a4e8a88f34fe29a1f33dad02e5332`. Then use it but with `notion://` prefix like `open notion://nikitavoloboev/Ideas-0b5a4e8a88f34fe29a1f33dad02e5332`.
