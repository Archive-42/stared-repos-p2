# There are no specs for this part of the project.

# This file is set up so that when you invoke the method below 
# you can run the query by inputting the following in your terminal: ruby lib/index_problems.rb
# The terminal results will "puts" out onto new lines (similiar to how it looks in psql). 
# Or you can test your queries with pure SQL in psql!

# REMINDER: INDEX ONLY AS NEEDED. 
# The flow for this part of the project will be to run the query as it is
# to see which parts of the query might be slowing you down. 
# (Is there a sequence scan with a high total cost? Maybe a Nested Loop with a high total cost?)

# Create an index based on your ideas and see if the total cost for that query is improved. 

# If the total cost does not fall within the specified range, drop that index using:
# DROP INDEX index_name;

# Once that query has reached the desired range move on to the next problem. 


def example_index_problem
  # This query can be improved by creating an index for cats.name in your database!
  # Try with and without the index to see the improvement.

  # Get cost within the range of: 4..15

  # In the Meowtime postgres database you can run the following to add an index:
  # CREATE INDEX cats_name ON cats(name);
