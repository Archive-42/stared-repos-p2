# Music

You can listen through a lot of the songs I liked on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0ERn0U4qZIKC8Dy7RrMMsn?si=1ApEajgvR_O_S9Oe-wXJLA), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0nGxteCFLXYA1fsLmlWzY0Tyoo3c7tF-) & [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/you/likes). And I share a lot of [playlists](music-playlists.md) and [music artists](music-artists.md) I love.

You can also see my most listened to [artists](https://www.last.fm/user/playfullyExist/library/artists), [songs](https://www.last.fm/user/playfullyExist/library/tracks) and [albums](https://www.last.fm/user/playfullyExist/library/albums) alongside my [yearly music stats](https://www.last.fm/user/playfullyExist/listening-report/year) tracked with [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/playfullyExist). And here are [my Spotify stats](https://volt.fm/nikitavoloboev) together with the song I am listening to now.

## Notes

- [Today in music theory, I learned that chords can use different octaves. It's painfully obvious when you think about it, but for some reason it never occurred to me.](https://merveilles.town/web/statuses/105834224452459065)
- [If you buy an album from Bandcamp, it's around the financial equivalent to the artist of you streaming their music every day for 3 years.](https://twitter.com/posthuman/status/1389480550432448513)
