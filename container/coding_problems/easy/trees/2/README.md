# Node Depths

Distance between a node in a Binar Tree and the tree's root is called the Node's depth.

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns the sum of its nodes' depth.

Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child node. Children nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes themselves or `None`/`null`.

* Average case: tree is balanced
* Optimal Space: O(h), where h is the hieght of the Binary Tree
* Optimal Time: O(n), where n is the number of nodes
