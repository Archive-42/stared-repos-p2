Practice your query syntax using GraphiQL to get a feel for how schemas are set up in GraphQL. For some of the below problems you need may need to perform more than one query to gather the information needed. Feel free to use this file to write out your queries before you copy and paste them into GraphiQL.

1. Query for all wizards whose patronus takes the form of a doe (id: 6)

2. Query for the wood, length, and core of all wands belonging to wizards in House Gryffindor (use multiple queries to do this).
