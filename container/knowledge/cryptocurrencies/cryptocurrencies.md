# Cryptocurrencies

I think [Solana](../databases/blockchain/solana.md)/[Tezos](../databases/blockchain/tezos.md) are the future of digital programmable money if compared to any other coin based on features.

It's a matter of time that [Bitcoin](bitcoin.md) won't be used due to its [wasteful & slow transactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0HC1Udk6-E) and [horrible PoW consensus algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4).

## Notes

- [The thing we call money is just an information system for labor allocation. What actually matters is making goods & providing services. We should look at currencies from an information theory standpoint. Whichever has least error & latency will win.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1349977642708168704)
- [China launches digital yuan. Adopted by nations tired of SWIFT abuse. Suddenly US can’t impose sanctions. Shift from apathy to panic, like COVID. But DC can’t build. So they deputize private USD stablecoins. And that is how a digital dollar may be born.](https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1395722987966455811)
