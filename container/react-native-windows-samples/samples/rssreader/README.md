This sample showcases the usage of React Native for Windows to build a [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) reader.	

It currently targets React Native Windows 0.62.

### Setup	
First, make sure you've met the [React Native Windows System Requirements](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/rnw-dependencies).	

Then, within this folder, install the application's dependencies. If you have `yarn` installed:	

```cmd	
yarn install	
```	

Otherwise, you can just use npm:	

```cmd	
npm install	
```	

### Run	
Once you have all of the dependencies installed, you can run the application with the following command:	

```cmd	
npx react-native run-windows	
```	

The command will:	
* Build the application and all dependencies	
* Deploy the application	
* Launch the React Native Server and Debugger	
* Launch the application
