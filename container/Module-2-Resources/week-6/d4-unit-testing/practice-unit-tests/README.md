# UNIT TESTING PRACTICE

Don't forget to npm install!

Inside this directory you will find three sub-directories
- `problems`: contains a `dog.js` that you will be writing tests for
- `test`: contains a `dog-spec.js` file, where you will be writing tests
- `solution`: contains a `dog-spec-solution.js` file that contains my solution
to the practice


Inside each `it` block in the `test/dog-spec.js` file you will see a commented out
message "// YOUR CODE HERE"
- replace this line with your test cases for each given spec
- run the specs using the command `npm test` and make sure each passes

Compare your code to my solution in the `dog-spec-solution.js` file when you're done!
