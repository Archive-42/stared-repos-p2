# [Software architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture)

## Inspiration

### Other

- [Things Network Stack for LoRaWAN V3](https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lorawan-stack) - Lovely contribution + github & git flow + good docs.
- [Deno Website](https://github.com/denoland/deno_website2)
- [gh CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli)

## Notes

- [Two traits of a good architecture: 1. It should nudge you to do things in a scalable way by default. You should only pay for what you use. 2. When something gets slow, there should be a straightforward way to fix it.](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1251864460526006273)
- [Tips to build a better software system](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24388753)
  1. Incremental improvement - implement a small version that works in a basic use case, then extend. Don't build it all in once.
  2. Reuse code. Don't reinvent the wheel
  3. Five whys - get to the root cause of why something should be done by asking yourself why many times. Understand the problem well before acting.
  4. Keep the solution as simple as possible. Minimization.
  5. Perfection can't be reached, so don't aim there. Be as good as necessary.
  6. Postpone complexity and introduce it only when really needed.
