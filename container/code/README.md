# [My Code Snippets](https://code.nikitavoloboev.xyz)

This wiki is now moved to [epictools.dev](https://epictools.dev/) using [Dendron](https://dendron.so/) to create and publish notes.

The source of this [GitBook](https://code.nikitavoloboev.xyz) is on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/code). It will be removed soon as I get more familiar with Dendron.

## Contributing

If you found a mistake anywhere, I would appreciate your help. GitBook provides a quick way to open GitHub page for any entry so you can make changes and submit a PR.

## Thank you
