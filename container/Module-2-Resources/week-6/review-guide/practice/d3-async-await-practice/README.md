# ASYNC / AWAIT PRACTICE

Inside this directory you will find two sub-directories (`solution`, `your-code`)
- write your solutions to the problems listed below in the `your-code` directory
- check your solutions against those I've provided in the `solution` directory


## Problem #1 (`your-code/problem_1.js`)

TODO: use `async` & `await` to create a function called `workout` that runs the 
given functions in a way that ensures you begin runningOnTreadmill after 
you're finished stretching, you begin liftWeights after you've finished 
running on the treadmill and console.logs "done working out" after 
you've finished lifting weights


TESTING
- run the file (`node problem_1.js`) and check your output against the expected
output I've provided at the bottom of the file





## Problem #2 (`your-code/problem_2.js`)

TODO: recreate the solution to problem #2 in your promise practice
using async and await

TESTING: 
- comment in each invocation of the workout function listed at the bottom
and run the file (`node problem_2.js`) to see if you get the expected output
