1. For every `if`, `def` (function definition), `loop` etc.. always place your end!!
2. Test often!! that way if you forget an end then you know around what line of code you committed the error 
3. Debugger Debuggers Debugges!!!
    * may seem like you don't have enough time to place debuggers but you really do have enough time.
    * stare at code for a maximum of 30s then begin to place debuggers to see whats going on 
4. You can test specs on at a time! Reference the README.md in this folder to see how to do that. 
5. Make sure to hop around questions if you get stuck at one problem for too long of a period of time.
