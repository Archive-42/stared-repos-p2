An application which allowed me to originally create [all of the maps](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/df7lxpsizx0ukd7/AAAUZzX55vnfZMqTRuhzJbWwa?dl=0) for [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz).

I visualize topics and their relations as an [interactive mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/fFxApNMuV2GmAzkBYxcD5quSFBM5wevdSMcRTz7H#1464.4,-1059.5,0).
