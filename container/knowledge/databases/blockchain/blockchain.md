# [Blockchain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)

In short, blockchain is a [immutable linked list of hashes](https://www.quora.com/Is-a-blockchain-essentially-a-linked-list). Which can be used to solve the double spending problem in cryptocurrencies using proof of stake (or other methods) and a persistent chain of records (blocks mined).

[Ethereum, Solana, Tezos & Avalanche are nice blockchains](https://twitter.com/dabit3/status/1434279108872216577).

## Consensus algorithms

- PoW: The more hashing power the more trust worthy.
- PoS: The more coins the more trust worthy.
- PBFT: Hand selected trusted nodes.
- Randomized asynchronous algorithm: You trust nobody! Every single node is constantly re-evaluated. ([Skycoin](https://www.skycoin.net))

## Notes

- [As blockchain scalability gets better and better, and UX improves and fees drop as a result, this will become a bigger and bigger part of the story.](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1072158957999771648)
- [For any given file on the internet, it is unknowable now many NFTs might be pointing to it. So putting aside all the questions about what "ownership" actually means in this context (spoiler: almost nothing), it's not possible to know who owns a file just by looking at the file.](https://twitter.com/felixsalmon/status/1381616082868436992)
- [NFTs are being wash traded. That’s when the buyer and the seller are secretly the same person.](https://twitter.com/JWWeatherman_/status/1431373325842923527)
