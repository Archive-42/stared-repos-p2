# Design

> Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

I can't call myself a designer yet but I am learning.

I do think design applies to everything I am doing. Even this wiki has some _design choices_ of how it can be structured. As the quote above says, it's not _how it looks like_, it's _how it works_.

Thus I try to be conscious of how my design decisions affect what I do. I like to use [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com) when designing things.

## Notes

- [A good way to make your interface look “designed” is to use a consistent space scale](https://twitter.com/siddharthkp/status/1264578950799523843)
- [Don't design for average. If you want to make a great product, it needs to be great for someone.](https://twitter.com/linuz90/status/1275678185657716736)
- [Design is about making things look a certain way. Not “make it look pretty” but “surface.” I have had many interactions with smart educated people (even designers!) whom seem to believe design is art, that design is mainly about surface (e.g. “a designer chair.”)](https://twitter.com/rsms/status/1305383261774905346)
- [Opinions are not ideas. Opinions are not as important as ideas. Opinions are just opinions.](https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1393305210563403776)
- [Don’t know where to start a design? literally just copy the next closest thing and then …just keep going.](https://twitter.com/round/status/1407767068263403520)
