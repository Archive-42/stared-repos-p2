# Javascript Developer Ultimate Guide

This is a complete guide to become an advanced javascript developer. Here you will find all you
need to know to develop both web, mobile, and native applications end-to-end using only js.

I will cover both frontend and backend related topics, and both client-side and server-side javascript.
You will learn the importance and how to of testing frameworks such as Mocha, how
to build your own Web Services using frameworks such as Express.js, and develop dynamic
frontend with React/React-Native.

This course will be developed iteratively so you might not find everything yet. It will also have
video lessons attached to it. I plan to make the core lessons, and everything you might need to
learn javascript from beginner to advanced, 100% free. But, those lessons and possible some
extra attachments that may come in handy will be found in Udemy eventually or some other
online-education platform at a modest price. Consider it like a donation more than anything else,
if you think one of that resources would be extremely useful for everybody and should be free,
please let me know, as my main concern is to let everybody know and access valuable information.
