Equity
  - Salary is guaranteed, but equity is not
  - Equity = any kind of ownership of the company
    - Stock that you buy or that is given to you
    - Options to buy Stock
  - Usually vests over 4 years with a 1-year cliff
  - Income is Taxed
  - Equity can be diluted
  - Equity = gambling.  Most startus don't win big
    - How long do you plan on staying with this company
  - Get runway and valuation from any startups
    - How long can they sustain with whatever funding they have
    - Check to see how long their runway is and their valuation
  - Great 3 part series on Stock Options (check on a/A)
  - Valuing Stock Options (check on a/A)

ELI personally negotiates for salary over equity
  - Definitely want to get more money
  - But, when you work for a company you will get a performance evaluation
    - Ask for equity at this point

You can negotiate for:
  - Salary - Don't leave $5k - $10k on the table!
  - Sign-on Bonuses (often come with a different account) - Frequently $5k, sometimes more
  - Performance Benefits
  - Benefits - $300 - $1k/month.  Most of the cost is medical.  Vision/Dental are cheaper.
  - Vacation - Some companies offer unlimited PTO
  - 401k - if ffered, frequently 50% matching up to max
  - Role, responsibilities, upward mobility, mentorship, etc.
  - Earlier review/ eligitbility for a raise
  - Equity - Ask for valuatio of company
  - Misc - parking, lunches, gym memberships, etc. - Do you need to relocate

Takeaways
  - Don't discuss salary until they are ready to make an offer
  - When yo uget an offer, first MAKE SURE YOU HAVE 2-3 WEEKS to decide
  - Discuss all non-salary items before you discuss salary
  - Don't negotiate over the phone
  - TALK WITH YOUR COACH!

Remember: YOU ARE WORTH IT!  If you don't ask for it, nobody will.

Use email templates for negotiation on a/A

- if you're interning or apprenticing to hire, good.
