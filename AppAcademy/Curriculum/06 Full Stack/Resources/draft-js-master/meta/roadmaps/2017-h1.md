# H1 2017 Roadmap Update

**tldr:** Our first goal is to achieve stability by catching up on releases, bug fixes, issues, and PRs. Other work on Draft.js is helpful, but may not get prioritized until the project reaches stability goals.

**Goal: project stability**

* Stable, regular releases
* Issues are triaged and closed regularly
* PRs are responded to and closed regularly

**The Master Plan:**

**Phase 1:** ðŸ”¥ Fix

**Phase 2:** ðŸ”§  Refactor

**Phase 3:** ðŸ’…  Polish

More on each phase below;

## Phase 1: Fixing the Problems

### January - June 2017 Roadmap

(NOTE: Imagine this as a timeline rather than an ordered list.)

1. ~~Release 0.10.0~~ [v0.10.0 released](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/releases/tag/v0.10.0)

2. Release 0.11.0@next for beta testing by community

3. Release any interim bug fixes as 0.10.1

4. Release 0.11.0, fully deprecating DraftEntity module

5. Start bi-weekly release cycle

6. Increased focus on reducing open PR and issue count


## Phase 2: Refactoring and Exploring

After establishing a stable state for the Draft.js project, we look forward to exploring new features and approaches. Some possible examples:

* Mobile browser support
* Nested blocks and nested decorators, possibly using a tree block structure (https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/143). This would be following up on the work started by SamyPesse and Mitermayer in https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/pull/388
* Exploring collaborative editing as a possible feature
* Improving copy/paste behavior

## Phase 3: Improve All the Things

Once we finish any significant refactors it's a safe time to focus on documentation, testing, and overall improvement of the codebase. Some possible examples:

* Increasing test coverage
* Improving documentation and writing tutorials
* Adding increased linting and modernizing the codebase with codemods

This could be when we consider a 1.0 release, if not sooner.

Thanks to the community for all your support and feedback - we look forward to
continuing to improve Draft.js.
