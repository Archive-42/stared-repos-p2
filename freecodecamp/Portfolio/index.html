<p><strong>Personal info:</strong></p>

<p>I was born and raised in the Bay Area -- living in Cupertino, Oakland, Morgan Hill, San Jose, Santa Cruz, and now Mountain View. 
When I was very young I developed a strong affinity for self-teaching.  I taught myself to read, to play piano, sing, and hear harmony, and have always loved science and math.
I also started gaming at a young age -- starting with PC games and then moving on to console games.
In school I was a three-sport athlete (football, basketball, and track) with a strong interest and aptitude for music, Physics, problem solving, and creativity.
After graduating SJSU I taught for 11 years. Subjects I taught included: Music (running a middle school music program), Physics, Engineering, Math, and Astronomy. 
Since leaving teaching in 2013 I started my own private tutoring business which has been pretty successful. I am now pursuing a degree in Software Engineering with a concentration in Gaming and Web and Mobile development.
I have always been passionate about how things work, troubleshooting, solving problems, and been self-motivated.  I also love working with all different types of people as well as learning and contributing
as much as possible in professional situations.  I have developed expertise as a vocalist, arranger, and producer, as a Physicist, a teacher, and now as a Software Developer.  I have
a dedication to excellence in everything I do.  Feel free to browse my portfolio if you would like to see some projects I have created or have been a part of.

My most recent music project is an EP called "Eyes on Me" with an all-vocal/acapella group called Business Casual. If you would like to hear some samples of my arranging and vocal work you can find them here:</p>

<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>

<p>My professional goals at this point can be separated into short and long-term.</p> <p> My short term goals include finishing my degree in Software Engineering and learning as much as I can about coding, software development, and game development.  I want to have a broad base of skills and languages, as well as a strong specialization in <b>Front End Web Development</b>.  Some of my past projects include slowly building my own Physics Engine in my spare time, <b>designing and coding my own portfolio website (this one using HTML/CSS/JavaScript)</b>, making a 3D pong game (JavaScript), making an interactive slide show (JavaScript), developing an RPG/puzzle game to be released in mid to late 2015 on iOS and Android but developed using the Unity Engine, and <b>coding at Sony PlayStation for 4 different PS4 titles.</b></p>
</div>

<p class="special">My long term goals include landing an initial position in game development as a Graphics or Physics programmer and eventually being able to specialize in Physics system development.  This could either be building an in-house Physics/Graphics system at a gaming company or working with popular middle-ware (Unity, PhysX, Havok, Bullet Physics, etc.) and integrating it into the larger game engine. <b>I am also interested in becoming a Full Stack Web Developer in gaming and non-gaming settings.</b></p>
