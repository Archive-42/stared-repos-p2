# React components

## Notes

- [Design System opinion: Don't make your <Link> and <Button> components support both link and button visuals. Do make your <Link> and <Button> components renders either <a> or <button> based on the props passed to it ("to" should render an anchor, "onClick" should render a button)](https://twitter.com/buildsghost/status/1389294014222934018)
