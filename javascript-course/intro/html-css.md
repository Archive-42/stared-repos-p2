# HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Javascript allows you to implement complex features on web pages, every time a web page does more that just sit there and display static information for you to look at, like displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc, you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies.

* HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, or embedding images and videos.
* CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in columns.
* JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, and pretty much everything else.
