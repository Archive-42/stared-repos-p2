      Hi (Direct Contact Name),
      Today I applied for the Software Developer position I saw on (app site) and noticed you are a REcruiter at (Amazing Company).  Whil I do not know if you are the right person to connect with, I definitely have the (Ruby, Front end, Full Stack, Angular, etc.) experience that youre team is seeking.  I believe I would be a great fit for your team because I am a skilled developer who can code quickly and can HIT THE GROUND RUNNING.
      You're probably very busy, but I would really enjoy the opportunity to hop on a quick Skype/call to learn more about you, the company and what roles you and your team are recruiting for.  Might you be free to chat for 15 minutes this week?
      In advance, I have attached my resume wfor yoru review and really appreciate your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you.
