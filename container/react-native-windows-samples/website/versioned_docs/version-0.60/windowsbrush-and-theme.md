## Overview

Windows supports two unique native styling/theming behaviors: one being the dark and light theme changes and the other being adaptive brushes and system colors. This article will show you how to set up your app to listen to theme changes and use the Windows brushes when and where you want.

### Setting up and handling theme changed events

In this example, we'll look at three things:

- How to set up your React Native app to be style and event sensitive to the system themes
- How to switch styles when a theme change has occurred
- Handling a theme changed event

#### Setting up your app to be sensitive to theme changes

First import the Platform API into your React Native app.

```JSX
import { AppTheme } from 'react-native-windows'
```

Create a local variable to use in a style conditional or to reference elsewhere, and then supply mounting functions to ensure that you are listening to the theme change events correctly.

```JSX
class MyAppClass extends Component {
  state = {
    currentTheme: AppTheme.currentTheme
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    AppTheme.addListener('appThemeChanged', this.onAppThemeChanged);
  };

  componentWillUnmount() {
    AppTheme.removeListener('appThemeChanged', this.onAppThemeChanged);
  };

  onAppThemeChanged = (event) => {
    const currentTheme = AppTheme.currentTheme;
    this.setState({currentTheme});
  };
}
```

#### Switching styles based on the app's theme

If the app author wants to switch the style of their component manually based on the system's theme (Dark or Light), they can do so with CSS-like style conditionals.

```JSX
 <Button title='click me' color={this.state.currentTheme === 'dark' ? 'grey' : 'orange'}/>
```

### Using Windows-defined theme brushes

These examples cover how to access and use the Windows system theme brushes and apply them in your styles.

#### Using theme brushes in a style

```JSX
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  title: {
    fontSize: 19,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: {windowsbrush: 'SystemControlPageTextBaseHighBrush'}
  },
});
```

#### Applying a system accent color variant

In Windows, there are algorithmically generated accent colors - dubbed Light or Dark 1, 2, and 3. This example covers what it would look like to apply that using the windowsbrush object.

```JSX
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  title: {
    fontSize: 19,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: {windowsbrush: 'SystemAccentColorLight3'}
  },
});
```

**Note:** That the system accent colors are `Color` objects at the native layer, whereas the other examples showed the use of theme brushes are `SolidColorBrush` objects. This means that the `SolidColoBrushes` will adapt automatically based on the Theme (Light, Dark or High Contrast), while the `Colors` will remain static.

### Using windowsbrush to access Reveal and Acrylic

Two awesome features about the native XAML platform are Reveal and Acrylic. These two Fluent Design visuals are only found in Windows 10 apps, but can easily be accessed through the same `windowsbrush` API we provide on the Javascript layer for other brushes.

#### Using System Acrylic

The `windowsbrush` api gives you access to all of the system acrylic brushes which can be accessed by resource name. Simply provide the resource brush name string in the component's style and it will be applied accordingly.

```JSX
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  viewcomponent: {
    backgroundColor: {windowsbrush: 'SystemControlAcrylicWindowBrush'}
  },
});
```

#### Applying Reveal Highlight

Reveal can be applied to surfaces exactly the same way that Acrylic and other system brushes are.

<img src="assets/reveal-surface-animation.gif" width="200" height="180"/>

```JSX
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  viewcomponent: {
    backgroundColor: {windowsbrush: 'SystemControlBackgroundAccentRevealBorderBrush'}
  },
});
```
