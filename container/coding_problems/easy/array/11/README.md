# Validate Subsequence

Given two non-empty array of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjance in the array but are in the same order as they appear in the array. For instance `[1,3,4]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,3,4]`, and so `[2,4]`.

* Optimal Time: O(n), where n is the length of the first array.
* Optimal Space: O(1)
