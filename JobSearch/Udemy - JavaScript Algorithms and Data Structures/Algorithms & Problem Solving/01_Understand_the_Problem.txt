Understand the problem
  1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
  2. Whare the inputs that go into the problem?
  3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
  4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?  In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay, it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
  5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

Example: Write a function which takes two numbers and return their sum.
1. Can I resstate the problem in my own words?
  - "Implement Addition"
2. Whare are the inputs that go into the problem?
  - really large numbers added together equal infinity
  - mixing data types? (Integers, floats?)
  - what about string for large numbers?
3. Whare are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
  - int, float, string?
