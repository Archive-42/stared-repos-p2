# Leadership

## Notes

- [If you are in a leadership position, part of your job is to say "no" on behalf of others who don't have the security to do so.](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1369502879023726596)
- [Leadership is not about being in charge. Leadership is about taking care of those in your charge.](https://twitter.com/simonsinek/status/1372249895894183942)
- [My advice for young people starting out in their careers: choose leaders who are competent, compassionate, and secure in themselves (not just pretending to be). Careers are long, and early role models have a disproportionately large impact on your trajectory—for better or worse.](https://twitter.com/jenistyping/status/1385393700855943170)
