# Parentheses Matching

Check for __balanced parentheses__ in an expression. Two brackets are considered to be matched pair if the opening bracket (`([{`) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (`)]}`).

For example
```
“[()]{}{[()()]()}” should return true
"[(])" should return false 
```

#### Precondition

* All characters are brackets/parentheses.

#### Restriction

* Solution should be O(n) time.
