# [Contacts](https://support.apple.com/guide/contacts/welcome/mac)

I use Contacts app as a contact book of people I both know and people I am interested in.

I use [this workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/tree/master/search-content) to quickly search through all my contacts. I add tags (i.e. the name of event we met at or person's skills/interests) to make both the searching and remembering who the person is or what he/she does easier.

I add `del` as part of the name contacts that are temporary. I then cleanup these contacts when they are no longer needed. i.e. You need to add person to Contacts just to send someone a WhatsApp message. Or agency contact for a place I rent.
