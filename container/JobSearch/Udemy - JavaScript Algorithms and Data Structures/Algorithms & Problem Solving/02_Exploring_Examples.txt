Explor Concrete Examples
  - Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
  - Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should
  - User Stories! - Given an input, what is our output?
  - Unit Tests

  1. Start with simple examples
    - an input and an output - write it down
  2. Progress to more complex examples
  3. Explroe Examples with Empty Inputs
  4. Explore Examples with Invalid Inputs

Example: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string
1. Start with simple examples
  charCount("aaaa") // => {a:4}
  charCount("hello") // => {h:1, e:1, l:2, o:1}
  - should we have 0 counts of letters not included?  Something to think about

2. Progress to more complex examples
  what if input is: "my phone number is 182763"
  - Do we count spaces?
  - Do we count numbers

  What about: "Hello hi"
  - Do we account for capitalization

3. Explore examples with empt Inputs
  charCount("")
  - what do we return?

4. Explore examples with invalid Inputs
  charCount(23)
  - convert to string then count
