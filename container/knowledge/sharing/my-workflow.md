- TODO: [Linear](https://linear.app/) is nice but GitHub is better integrated and is free. Just needs [Linear](https://linear.app) or [Ship](https://www.realartists.com/blog/ship-20.html) level client.

## Cloud Compute

- [AWS](../cloud-computing/aws/aws.md)/[GCP](https://cloud.google.com) depending on service needed. GCP interface is nicer.
