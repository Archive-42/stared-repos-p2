# Objective C

## Notes

- [To learn ObjC: Best start with the first chapter or two in any intro book, then start a new Xcode Project in Obj-C and make a simple app that does something. Just getting exposed to all the APIs you currently use in their Obj-C forms makes thinking in the language so much easier.](https://twitter.com/NathanBLawrence/status/1394694493073457159)
