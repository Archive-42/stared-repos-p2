# Assessment 00 Instructions

**Do not share this assessment or post it publicly. We will take
violations very seriously.**

* We will take 35 minutes for this assessment.
* Don't worry if you can't pass every spec in the time limit; do the
  best you can.
* Instructions for each problem are included in the `lib/a00.rb` file.
  * Run the specs as you solve the assessment.
  * To run the specs, run `bundle exec rspec` from the assessment
    directory.
  * To run one specific spec, add `:line_number`, which references the
    line at the beginning or middle of a test, to the end. For example,
    `bundle exec rspec spec/a00_spec.rb:10`.
  * You will be evaluated based on the number of specs passed. It is in
    your interest to tackle easier problems first; this will help you
    pass specs earlier.
  * Look at the title of the spec to see why it failed; you can also
    read the spec code for more information.
  * Please ask your TAs any questions. If you get stuck or don't know
    why something is failing, ask. TAs will let you know whether they
    can answer your question, so ask anything.
  * Do not use the internet or prior notes.
  * To submit:
    * Rename the directory `firstname_lastname` (using your actual
      name).
    * ZIP it (you can use OS X's built-in zip functionality)
    * Use the `.zip` format; Progress Tracker will not accept other
      formats.
    * Upload to Progress Tracker (http://progress.appacademy.io/).
