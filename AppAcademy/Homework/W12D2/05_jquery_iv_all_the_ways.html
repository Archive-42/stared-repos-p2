jQuery Part IV: All The Ways
Let's review all the ways that $ can be used:

Selector-style
$("ul.cool-things")
Takes in a CSS selector.
Returns a jQuery object containing all elements matching that selector.

HTML-style
$("<li>Racecars</li>")
Takes in a string of HTML code.
Builds HTMLElements for the content, returns a jQuery object containing the top-level elements you built.

Wrapper-style
$(nativeDomElement), $(arrayOfDomElements)
Takes in an unwrapped HTMLElement or array of several elements.
Returns a jQuery wrapping those, giving you access to the jQuery methods.

Ready-style
$(someFunction)
Takes a function to run when the DOM is fully loaded; does not run it yet.
Returns nothing.
