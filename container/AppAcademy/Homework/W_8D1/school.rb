  # there should only be a single connection to the database; there
  # shouldn't be multiple simultaneous connections. A call to
  # `SchoolDatabase::new` will result in an error. To get access to the
  # *single* SchoolDatabase instance, we call `#instance`.
  #
  # Don't worry too much about `Singleton`; it has nothing
  # intrinsically to do with SQL.
