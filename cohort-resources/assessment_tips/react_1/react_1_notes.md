### Tips for Success
1. If you're uncomfortable with them, familiarize yourself with both [Facebook's Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/getting-started.html#content) and [Airbnb's Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/#basic-usage) testing frameworks. Both are used on this assessment.
2. Read BOTH READMEs!
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `bundle install`
5. Run `bundle exec rails db:setup`
    * Be sure you have PostgresSQL running
6. Run the specs using `npm test`
7. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the DB Schema and Backend
    * Note: You will not have to write any Backend code
8. Be sure to run the tests in the order the README states
9. Read the Error messages
10. If you're unsure of what the spec is trying to do, open up the test file and see how it's expecting to behave
    + tests can be found in the `/frontend/__test__/` folder
11. If you are very stuck, you can run your rails server using `rails s` and start webpack using `npm run build:webpack` to test things in the chrome browser
12. You will not need to do any imports or exports on this assessment. They are provided
    + The provided imports also give you clues to what you will need for that file *wink wink*
13. Be sure to read the comments at the top of each file outlining what to do for this file
14. After you have attempted the practice assessment, watch the Video Guides
