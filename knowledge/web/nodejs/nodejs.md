# [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

I use [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) to publish packages.

## Notes

- [I use package.json scripts as entrypoints to custom JS scripts. Make is a build tool, not a meta-shellscript format.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26978206)
- [`yarn upgrade-interactive --latest` to bulk choose which packages to upgrade to latest version.](https://twitter.com/debs_obrien/status/1399256756216381441)
