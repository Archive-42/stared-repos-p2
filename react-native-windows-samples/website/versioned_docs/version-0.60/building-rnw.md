- Make sure you have installed all of the [development dependencies](rnw-dependencies.md)
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) if you don't have it installed in your development machine

## Build Steps

- Clone the repo

  ```cmd
  git clone https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows.git
  cd react-native-windows
  ```

- Install dependencies, and run JS build steps
  ```cmd
  yarn
  yarn build
  ```

# Running the Playground app

There are two ways to run the app. In a fully managed easy way, or by manually running all the required steps:

## Automatic

The playground app can be run in a completely automatic way by using `react-native run-windows`.

If you haven't already, install the react-native-cli (One time only!)

```cmd
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

Then

```cmd
cd packages\playground
react-native run-windows
```

## Manual

### Run the bundle server:

```cmd
cd packages\playground
yarn start
```

### Build solution

- Using MSBuild

  ```cmd
  MSBuild.exe [/p:Platform=$(TargetPlatform)] [/p:Configuration=$(TargetConfiguration)]
  ```

- Using Visual Studio IDE
  1. Open `Playground.sln`.
  2. Set your `Platform` to `x86` or `x64` and `Configuration` to `Debug`.
  3. Select `Project / Build Solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)`

### Ensure debugger is running

Open Chrome and navigate to `http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui/` in a new tab. Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` in Chrome to open its Developer Tools.

### Run the app

- In Visual Studio, set Playground as the StartUp Project.

- Run project (`F5` or `Debug / Start Debugging`).

You now see your new app and Chrome should have loaded `http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui/` in a new tab. Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` in Chrome to open its Developer Tools.

### Load a sample bundle

- Press the "Load" button on the left side of the Windows 10 application window that appears.

The selected React Native component (defaulted to `Bootstrap`) should get loaded in the bottom of the application window

Try out the various samples by selecting from the comboboxes at the top of the application window and pressing "Load".
