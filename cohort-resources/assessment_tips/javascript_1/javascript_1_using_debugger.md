* There are tools available to you in this palette that allow you to watch variables, step through sequentially through your code, and step into function that are called within the function you’re debugging. These are highlighted red in the first picture.
* Opening up the console drawer is also very helpful because it lets you write out quick math, and variables that you may want to check quickly. To open up the drawer and the bottom, you press the button with the three dots at the top right and click "show console drawer". The big red box at the bottom of the first image is the console drawer.
* Make sure to become comfortable with this tool as it will not only help with js01 but with the rest of your front end development projects that you will encounter during your projects.
