<h3>This is a naive check if React can be used as multi page "application" using React</h3>

<h4>functionality</h4>
  <p>the "application" has two html pages each one is using ReactDOM.render. 
	it is possible to navigate between the pages thus making it multi page application</p>
	
<h4>Limitiation</h4>
<ol>
 <li>component reuse is not done - worth a try</li>			
 <li>i did not try to implement it using create-react-app - worth a try</li>			
</ol>
