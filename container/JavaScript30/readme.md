* [Dave Follett's](https://github.com/davefollett) blog series, [A New Vue on #JavaScript30](https://davefollett.io/categories/a-new-vue-on-javascript30/), where he explores re-implementing #JavaScript30 projects using [Vue](https://vuejs.org).

* [Adrien Poly](https://github.com/adrienpoly/javascript30-stimulus) a modest attempt to convert Drum Kit, Video Player, Local Tapas, TypeHead to [Stimulus JS](https://stimulusjs.org/) framework in a Rails App.

## A note on Pull Requests

These are meant to be 1:1 copies of what is done in the video. If you found a better / different way to do things, great, but I will be keeping them the same as the videos.

The starter files + solutions will be updated if/when the videos are updated.

Thanks!
