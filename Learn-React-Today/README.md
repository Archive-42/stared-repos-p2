# Learn React Today - [Course Page](https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/learn-react-today)

This repo is meant to be used as a reference for the Learn React Today course. All of the code for each video is individually separated into their own folders to make following along as easy as possible.

## Folder Structure

Each folder in this repo correspond one-to-one to the video in the course with the exact same name. The code in each folder is the final product of the video that is referenced. For example, the code in `04 - JSX` is the code from the end of the `04 - JSX` video. If you want the code from the beginning of the video then you need to download the code from the folder for the previous video. In this example, the code for the beginning of the `04 - JSX` video would be inside the folder `03 - Environment Setup`.
