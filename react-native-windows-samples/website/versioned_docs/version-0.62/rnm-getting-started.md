This guide will help you get started on setting up your very first React Native for macOS app.

For information around how to set up:
- React Native for iOS and Android: See [React Native Getting Started Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
- React Native for Windows: See [React Native for Windows Getting Started Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/getting-started)

Make sure you have installed all the [development dependencies](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/rnm-dependencies)

## Install React Native for macOS

Remember to call `react-native init` from the place you want your project directory to live.

```
npx react-native init <projectName> --version 0.62.0
```

### Navigate into this newly created directory

Once your project has been initialized, React Native will have created a new sub directory where all your generated files live.

```
cd <projectName>
```

### Install the macOS extension

Install the React Native for macOS packages.

```
npx react-native-macos-init
```

## Running a React Native macOS App

- **Without using Xcode**:
  In your React Native macOS project directory, run:

  ```
  npx react-native run-macos
  ```

- **Using Xcode**:
  Open macos\test.xcworkspace in Xcode or run `xed -b macos`; `yarn start:macos`. Hit the Run button.

A new Command Prompt window will open with the React packager as well as a `react-native-macos` app. This step may take a while during first run since it involves building the entire project and all dependencies. You can now start developing! ðŸŽ‰

# Upgrading

If you're on 0.61 of React Native for macOS and would like to upgrade 0.62, here's how you can:

1. Bump dependencies: `yarn add 'react@16.11.0' 'react-native@0.62.2' 'react-native-macos@0.62.0'`
2. In `macos/Podfile` replace
```
pod 'ReactCommon/jscallinvoker', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-macos/ReactCommon'
pod 'Folly', :podspec => '../node_modules/react-native-macos/third-party-podspecs/Folly.podspec'
```
with
```
pod 'ReactCommon/callinvoker', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-macos/ReactCommon'
pod 'RCT-Folly', :podspec => '../node_modules/react-native-macos/third-party-podspecs/RCT-Folly.podspec'
```
