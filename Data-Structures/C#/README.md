C# Data Structures
-------------------

- All data structures in C# will only have the Source code uploaded
- The data structures are in a Class Library
- Each data structure is in it's own namespace to prevent the "Node" class from conflicting, this means that each one will contain "namespace DataStructures.DATA_STRUCTURE_NAME"

- Data structures cannot be tested in their own folder, it will instead be tested from a central file
