# Learning web development

## Goal of this training

This training provides an opinionated ramp-up program for web developers.

Prerequisites: not much, just general knowledge about computers and the Internet.

## Principles

- Focus on the main stuff. A lot of things are learnt on the job anyway.
- Programming is not only about raw technical knowledge,
  it's also about best practices.
- Go wide and go deep.
- We learn by doing, so this training includes lots of exercises.
- A lot of videos are included, since they provide hands-on experiences. You
  can find a LOT more videos here: [hellerve/programming-talks](https://github.com/hellerve/programming-talks) and [talks that changed the way I think about programming](http://www.opowell.com/post/talks-that-changed-the-way-i-think-about-programming/)

Note: this is just a short selection of stuff listed in
[charlax/professional-programming](https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming).

### Meta: learning about learning

Feel free to checkout some of the articles about [Learning and memorizing](https://github.com/charlax/professional-programming#learning--memorizing)

- Create a learning plan with your learning priorities
- Consider using flashcards (see Anki for instance)
- Enjoy the learning experience!

## Roadmap

1. Start with a programming language.
2. Do a first pass at the web development environment (see introductory resources below)
    - HTTP and web architecture basics
    - Git
    - Docker and `docker-compose`
    - Command line
    - Text editor
3. Write a full-fledged exercise, get it reviewed.
4. Do the advanced topics

## Approach

### Pick a powerful text editor and learn its ins and outs

VSCode is a strong pick nowadays (I use and obviously prefer Vim :).

Make sure to spend a lot of time in your text editor, watch tutorials about
advanced features, install extensions, learn all the main keyboard shortcuts,
subscribe to mailing lists about it, etc.

You will spend most of your time within your text editor. Turn it into
a powerful ally!

### Learn the ins and outs of one programming language

A developer's main tool being the programming language, it is important to
achieve high proficiency in at least one of them.

I'd recommend starting with Python or TypeScript. For Python, you can have a look at my repo [charlax/python-education](https://github.com/charlax/python-education).

To ensure you have good command of the language, you should try out some of
those exercises:

- [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) (get free code reviews!)
- [Small Python exercises from charlax/python-education](https://github.com/charlax/python-education/tree/master/learning-python/exercises)
- [danistefanovic/build-your-own-x](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x) (for instance: build a [git in Python](https://wyag.thb.lt/))
- [Other list of exercises](https://github.com/charlax/python-education#exercises)

Watch some videos related to your language:

- ðŸŽž [Top 10 Must-Watch PyCon Talks](https://realpython.com/must-watch-pycon-talks/)

Learn how to handle:

- Regexes
    - Do exercises, for instance [RegexOne](https://regexone.com/) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex).
- Functional programming
    - [Functional Programming Fundamentals](https://www.matthewgerstman.com/tech/functional-programming-fundamentals/)
- Design patterns
    - E.g. in [Python](https://www.toptal.com/python/python-design-patterns)
    - [faif/python-patterns](https://github.com/faif/python-patterns)
    - ðŸŽž [Design Patterns in Plain English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU_1StN5Tkk&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh)
- Tests
    - [Why bother writing tests at all?](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/05/14/why-bother-writing-tests-at-all)
- Crazy things in languages
    - ðŸŽž [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)

If you have time, learn more programming languages, starting with some that are
*very* different from your main one:

- Haskell
- Clojure
- Kotlin
- Rust
- Assembly
