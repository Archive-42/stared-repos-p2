# TEX

The TeX editor in the Draft repository provides a live example of custom block rendering, with TeX syntax translated on the fly into editable embedded formula rendering via the [KaTeX library](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/).

### How to run

```bash
# in draft-js folder
yarn
cd examples/draft-0-9-1/tex
yarn
yarn start
```

which will open a server listening on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
