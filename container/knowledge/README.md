Aside from this wiki, I am using [Dendron](https://dendron.so) to grow a [more powerful version of my digital second brain](https://epictools.dev/). And build [Learn Anything](ideas/learn-anything.md).

## Other things I wrote and shared

I share my knowledge in longer form by [writing articles](sharing/my-articles.md) and making [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKqrUfr_FMKIO9XSJS4vDw/videos).

I also love [writing code](sharing/my-github.md) that solves various problems I have and I share it all on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev).

[Here](sharing/sharing.md) you can find all the things I made and shared thus far.

## Grow your own digital garden üå±

Such wikis are also called [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). There is a [DigitalGardens community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) which discusses tools to maintain & create these wikis. As well as how to use them to develop [new transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).

I collected a list of [wikis I liked the most](other/wiki-workflow.md#similar-wikis-i-liked) for inspiration.

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.
