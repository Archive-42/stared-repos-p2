# HTTP, Promises, and TDD (Week 6) - Learning Objectives


## HTTP (W6D1) - Learning Objectives

### HTTP
1. Match the header fields of HTTP with a bank of definitions.
2. Matching HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, DELETE) to their common uses.
3. Match common HTTP status codes (200, 302, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500) to their meanings.
4. Send a simple HTTP request to google.com
5. Write a very simple HTTP server using ‘http’ in node with paths that will result in the common HTTP status codes.


## Promises - Part 1 (W6D2) - Learning Objectives

### Promises
1. Instantiate a Promise object
2. Use Promises to write more maintainable asynchronous code
3. Use the fetch API to make Promise-based API calls


## Promises - Part 2 and HTML Review (W6D3) - Learning Objectives

### Promises
1. Use async/await with promise-based functions to write asynchronous code that behaves synchronously.

### HTML
- Be comfortable with using the following tags. This is review/tangential material and will not be tested directly on the assessment, but if it would appear in a problem, you should know what it is doing.
    - html
    - head
    - title
    - link
    - script
    - The six header tags
    - p
    - article
    - section
    - main
    - nav
    - header
    - footer
    - Itemized list tags
        - ul
        - ol
        - li
    - a
    - img
    - Tabular-data tags
        - table
        - thead
        - tbody
        - tfoot
        - tr
        - th
        - td


## Testing in JavaScript (W6D4) - Learning Objectives

### Testing
1. Explain the "red-green-refactor" loop of test-driven development.
2. Identify the definitions of SyntaxError, ReferenceError, and TypeError
3. Create, modify, and get to pass a suite of Mocha tests
4. Use Chai to structure your tests using behavior-driven development principles.
5. Use the pre- and post-test hooks provided by Mocha
6. Be familiar with `chai-spies` and its ability to test how many times a function is invoked
