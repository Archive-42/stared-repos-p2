Use contants that show relative direction from an origin:
LINEAR_DIRS [[1,0], [-1,0], [0, 1], [0,-1]]
DIAGONAL_DIRS [[-1,1],[-1,-1],[1,-1],[1,1]]


move_dirs
  - will call grow_unblocked_moves_in_dir to loop through arrays

#moves
- will return an array of all possible moves
- will call move_dirs to create the arrays

grow_unblocked_moves_in_dir(dx, dy)
- will return an array from origin and in the direction given
- will take a direction via (x,y) #such as 1,1
- it will "grow" an array based off @pos and stop growing
   when it finds a NullPiece, whereupon it will return the array
