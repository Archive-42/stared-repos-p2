# OOP with Python

* [Class and Instance declaration](./class.py)
  * Constructor (`__init__`)
  * `@classmethod` & `@staticmethod`
  * Property decorator
  * Private members (`_method`)
* [Inheritance](./inheritance.py)
* [Polymorphism](./polymorphism.py)
* [Multiple Inheritance](./multiinheritance.py)
  * __MRO - Method Resoluton Order__: When we search for an attribute in a class that is involved in python multiple inheritance, an order is followed. First, it is searched in the current class. If not found, the search moves to parent classes. This is left-to-right, depth-first.
