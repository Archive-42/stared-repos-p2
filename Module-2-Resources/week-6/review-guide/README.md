# WEEK 6 STUDY SUGGESTIONS

Here is a suggested outline for studying this weekend:

1. Fill In Learning Objective Document
	 - first: fill out the empty LO document on your own (`LOs_empty.md`)
	 - then: compare your document with the filled out version (`LOs_explained.md`)


2. Review Weekly Notes
   - additional notes on each days' topics can be found in the `notes` directory


3. Review the practice exercises in the `practice` directory
   - inside you will find a directory for each topic that contains practice 
	 exercises for each of those topics
	 - instructions for each can be found in their respective `README.md` files
	 - recommended order:
	   1. `d2-promise-practice`
		 2. `d3-async-await-practice`
		 3. `d4-unit-testing-practice`


* Reminder: any topics covered in my weekly notes or in the LOs 
are fair game for the assessment!
