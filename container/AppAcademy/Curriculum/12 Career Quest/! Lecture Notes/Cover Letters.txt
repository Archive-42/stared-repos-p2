especially in 5 seconds



Your STORY.
Why YOU!
Why THEM?

Story
  - Has a past, present, and future.
YOU | THEM
  - What do you bring to the table for them?

The power of Three
  - talk about Your Story
  - talk  About you
  - talk About them

This format makes it easy to make a templated cover letter where all you have to change is just a few sections for each job


THE BEGINNING
  - You Story - START OFF WITH A BANG!
    - Have a great opening line that grabs attention
      - Don't start off with "I am a software developer"
      - What brought you into the industry?
      - What might be your "Superpower"?
      - Something that starts off from where you were and where you are at now. *
      - Something really relevant about the cmopany and you
        - ex. Amazon
      P.S. You can also start with "I was referred..." Or "My friend Kelly works in your... team"
      If you found them via clear bit, put that person's name in the subject line

Main Body Paragraph
  - What is YOUR software development story in relation to the job description??
    - Languages you know/they want (React, Ruby/Rails, JavaScript)
    - What is a project your are working on (with links) that you can showcase?
    - Something you accomplished in your life related to software developer
    - Other skills

Main Body Paragraph - THEM
  - Make You AND THEM important
    - Based on the job description how can you bring value?
    - What interests you about applying?
    - Why would you be a good fit?
      - "Hit the ground running!"
      - Experience?
      - Knowledge?
      - Culture?
      - Values?

THE END
  - Thank them for their time and consideration
  - "I appreciate your time and hope that we may be able to schedule a time to chat..."
  - "I would enjoy the opportunity to further discuss my overall accomplishments and achievements as to why I would be an asset to your team.  I hope we can schedule a chat later."

HELPFUL HINTS
  - What's your story?
  - A few paragraphs:
    - Introduction of who you are
    - Company specific blurb
    - Technical skills
    - Additional skills
    - Links to your project or portfolio
    - Thank You
    - "Package"
      - If you're with a specialized template, that spans multiple documents, the look (headers/titles) should match

Top 3 Key Mistakes
  1. Not original - exact replica of sample cover letters in curriculum
  2. Not tailored to the company - no company specific blurb
  3. Not tailored to the position - skills listed aren't relevant to job description

  Mistake #1 - Not original
    - Do not copy and paste sample cover letters
    - Jot down bullet points of what you want to describ in each paragraphs
    - Review each sentence to see if it supports what you want to describe
    - Each section should flow well into the next paragraph
  
  Mistake #2 Not tailored to the company
    - BAD EXAMPLE 1: I heard about Happy Travled from a friend and checked out your landing page.  I love the mission -- I lived abroad, and the best travel experiences were the ones not yet in the Lonely Planet.  I'd Love to contribute to building this experience for other like-minded travelers as a web developer.
      - What friend? Why should they care?
      - Landing page
      - I love section... What value do you bring?
      - Too much Love
      - How would you contribute to the experience?
    - BAD EXAMPLE 2: I enjoy shopping online and especially like it when the experience is streamlined on your site.  I believe my passion for online shopping and my skills will make me perfect for your company.
      - Not really tailored
      - What are the SKILLS?
      - I enjoy shopping online?
    - BAD EXAMPLE 3: GeneriCo's user base is growing fast.  I've dealt with scaling databases and leveraged my mathematics background to develop faster algorithms that enabled further growth.
      - Not as bad
      - Could tie into the cmopany better
      - Good on the mat/algo skills

  Mistake #3 Not tailored to the Position
    - Review serveral job description and note key skills typically mentioned
    - Draft various paragraphs for technical and other skills
    - Insert skills paragraphs most relevant to job description
    - Hint: Typically the first 3 to 5 bullet points are the most important
    - Hint: Typically the first 3 skills are the most important
  
  Sample Technical Skills paragraphs:
    - Option 1 - frontend:
      My passion is creating software that is beautiful and interactive. You can see an example of my frontend skills in my project [name/link]. I achieved the smooth user interface through careful utilization of React rendering and event listeners, and used Flexbox with React transitions for the clean, pixel perfect look.
    
    - Option 2 - fullstack:
      My passion is creating software that's fast, functional, and beautiful.  My skills extend across the full stack, including a variety of languages and frameworks.  In a recent project, [name/link], I used React with Redux to create a clean, interactive, optimized frontend, and Rails with a PostgreSQL database for the backend.


  Style... Keep it simple AND Effective
    - Typically a cover letter is half to 2/3rds of a page
    - Have bulleted points in a cover letter should be related to exactly the job description.
    - Have a few bold words is also helpful
    - Definitely need something easy to customize without having to recreate the wheel each time.

TAKE AWAYS:
  1. Have an awesome opening statement about you.
  2. Discuss skills and a project taht is relevant with links
  3. Talk about you and the company
  4. Thank and appreciate their time
