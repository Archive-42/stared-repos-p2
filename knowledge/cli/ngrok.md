# [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

I use it to tunnel my localhost server to share with other people. Useful for development.

## Using it

Say I started my local server on port 3000. This command: `ngrok http 3000` will create a shareable link of my tunneled server.

## Notes

- [ngrok lets you inspect incoming requests in a web UI, and even replay past requests.](https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1379092674280579082)
