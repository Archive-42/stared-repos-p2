# Draft.js Weekly 09/08/2017

Agenda Items:
* * Super awesome docs PR - https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/pull/1371#pullrequestreview-61521213
* How does long-term OS work at FB?
    * Projects to take inspiration from
        * React
            * has a team building new things in the open
            * this is the far side of the spectrum
        * FB has had other projects which were put in OS and then dropped fully
        * Draft is in the middle
            * Some level of ownership (weekly meetings, part-time maintainers)
    * General impression
        * Encouraged but not fully supported, could be better supported
        * Generally FB wants external folks to take over, unless it is a big enough project for a whole team
        * Hard for people to know how much to value it in calibrations
        * Hard to know the impact of work for community vs. internal focused work
        * The OS team is working on figuring this out
    * For new projects
        * New OS projects require eng. director sign off, team commits to support for 6 months
        * But what happens after the 6 months pass?
    * What about external maintainers?
        * React example:
            * External folks are very involved, very helpful, especially for non-critical things
            * Can't actually offload that much work onto them;
                * Often requires context on big picture or internal changes
            * Plus we worry about them landing big changes without seeing the effects within FB
        * Even more is up in the air -
            * They might have different priorities, unknown commitment
    * Draft basically “works” for most use cases, is in a pretty good state
        * Community needs and FB needs are basically the same, if someone worked on it full time internally it would likely hit community needs 100%
        * It's a narrow project - lends itself to stability
        * Could make a case for more investment within FB potentially
