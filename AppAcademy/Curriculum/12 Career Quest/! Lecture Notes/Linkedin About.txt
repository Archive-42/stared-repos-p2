I've been called the tech whisperer because I figure out all the new fancy tech.

In Truth, I'm adept with understanding physical tech--be it refrigeration, circuit boards, repairing laptops/phones, or working on cars--but not long ago was fuzzy on all the soft mechanisms.  I'd look at code bases and felt I was looking at hieroglyphics.  It sincerely bothered me, making me doubt my quality of intelligence.  So much so that one day I made a drastic change in my life.  I took a leap of faith, swallowed the red pill, and tumbled down the coding rabbit hole.  After getting a taste of real understanding, I'm hell bent on learning it all!

Now I spend my time growing software skills and honing my coding prowess--currently working with JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, React, Redux, Apollo, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL (still in search of more).

Pre-empting my coding epiphany, I focused on the presentational aspects; working with HTML, CSS, and ActionScript (when it was still popular).  I generally gravitate toward the aesthetic workings of a tech piece before focusing on it's core mechanics which is why I fall into time-sinks styling, illustrating, or occasionally animating.

I'm comfortable working in pairs, groups, collaborating on GitHub, and packaging with Docker.  I also enjoy working with Adobe[Photoshop, Illustrator, Premier, AfterEffects, Animate].

In my spare time, I like to sketch, practice Aikido, and (surprise) play video games.

Personal Pedagogy:
 - All techniques are derived from single principles of truth (e.g. balance, timing, sensitivity)
 - Be funny

I've been called the tech whisperer because I figure out all the new fancy tech.

In truth, the first time I heard that, it was disconcerting.  I understood the bells and whistles of most tech, but was fuzzy on the internal mechanisms.  It vexed me so much that I started reading through code, not fully able to understand.  How could I be the tech whisperer?  Well, there was really only one thing to do.  I took the red pill, jumped down the coding rabbit hole, and after getting a taste, I'm hell bent on learning it all.

Before my actual coding journey, however, I was focused on the presentational side; working with HTML, CSS, and ActionScript (when it was still popular).  I've always gravitated toward the aesthetics of a tech piece before its function.

I've been called the tech whisperer because I figure out all the new fancy tech.

In truth, that statement bothered me because I understood the bells and whistles, but not the mechanisms. Then I started becoming obsessed with how a technology worked and knew there was only one way to truly understand. So I took the red pill, jumped down the coding rabbit hole, and now I'm hell bent on learning it all.
