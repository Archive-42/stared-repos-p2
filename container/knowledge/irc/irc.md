# [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)

I spend some time on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/) as it has many useful channels and people that can help you.

I like IRC even though Discord is a strictly superior experience. I currently use Matrix and [Element](https://element.io) client to connect to IRC Freenode channels I care about.

Previously I used [Textual](../macOS/apps/textual.md) IRC client and [ZNC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZNC) network bouncer (via [LunarBNC](https://lunarbnc.net)) to always keep me logged in to the servers as well as it keeping history logs when I am away.

Here are IRC channels I frequent:

## IRC commands

Textual keeps a command reference [here](https://help.codeux.com/textual/Command-Reference.kb).

- `/list` - Open channel list.
- `/msg *nickserv set <yourNSpassword>` - Lets Nickserv autologin you. Can then run `/nick <your-nick>` to login.

## Notes

- If I ever get issues with logging in and me being Guest. I can:
  - `/msg NickServ RELEASE <nickname> <password>`
  - `/nick nikivi` my nick
