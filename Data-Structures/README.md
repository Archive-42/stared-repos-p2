# Data-Structures
This is my implementation of data structures.
This is to both assist myself in future for when i may need a specific data structure, as well as assist in learning different languages by focussing on the syntax with the logic already present.

All data structures must be entirely self sufficient, i.e. no dependencies
Each file must contain a single Data structure with all of the functionality contained
