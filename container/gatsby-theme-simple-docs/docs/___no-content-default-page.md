Welcome to your super-sweet docs site, powered by [`gatsby-theme-simple-docs`](https://github.com/jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-simple-docs)!

To get started, add a files to the `docs/` directory called called `index.md` with the following information in it:

```
---
title: My New Doc
description: Something for Google to use in search results.
---

This is my new doc!
```

You can create files with any name, and in folders if youâ€™d like. The link will match the file names, so `get-started.md` will become `/get-started/` on the site.
