# Basic income

[This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBUYB3F0NU) by Alan Watts was amazing.

Technology and automation will not stop and more things will be automated with every day. I do believe we will reach a [zero marginal cost society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-iDUcETjvo) or close to it where the costs of manufacturing will be brought down significantly in my lifetime. Basic income then seems like the most sensible solution to the problem of allocating funds and resources amongst most people. At least just enough to not feel constant pressure and anxiety to do things just to survive. And ideally let the person do the things he wants to do or build or learn.
